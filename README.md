# AI Project - Numerics: Recommendation System

## Project Overview
[cite_start]The main goal of this project is to design and implement a recommendation system[cite: 1, 3]. 
[cite_start]This is an open-theme project, meaning the domain (e.g., movies, books, products) is up to the group's preference[cite: 3].

## Team Structure
* [cite_start]**Team Size:** 4-5 students per group[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Representative:** One elected representative per group will handle the final presentation[cite: 21].

## Project Requirements

### Minimal Tasks (Mandatory)
To meet the core requirements, the system must include the following:
1.  [cite_start]**Dataset Selection:** * Choose an existing dataset or create a new one[cite: 28].
    * [cite_start]**Constraint:** Select a dataset that supports both **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** to avoid having to manage two separate datasets[cite: 34, 35].
2.  [cite_start]**Collaborative Filtering:** Implement **matrix factorization from scratch**[cite: 36].
3.  [cite_start]**Content-Based Filtering:** Create a system using **deep embeddings** (e.g., CLIP, BERT, or other learned embeddings)[cite: 37].
4.  [cite_start]**Evaluation:** Define appropriate metrics and build a pipeline to evaluate and compare the models[cite: 38].

### Improvement Ideas (Bonus/Advanced)
To extend the project beyond the basics, consider implementing:
* [cite_start]**Diversity mechanisms** in recommendations[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Explainability** features (why a recommendation was made)[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Hybrid Methods:** Combining collaborative and content-based approaches[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Architectures:** Such as two-tower models[cite: 44].
* [cite_start]**Deployment:** A web browser extension to recommend content while browsing[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]Any other creative implementation[cite: 46].

## Data Resources
Recommended starting points for datasets:
* [cite_start][Kaggle Recommender Systems](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=recommender+systems) [cite: 30, 31]
* [cite_start][GitHub: Caserec Datasets](https://github.com/caserec/Datasets-for-Recommender-Systems) [cite: 32, 33]

## Logistics & Schedule
[cite_start]**Supervision Hours:** 2 PM – 3 PM daily[cite: 14].
[cite_start]**Rooms:** * Tuesday - Thursday: A28, Room 205[cite: 9, 10, 11].
* [cite_start]Friday: A28, Room 207[cite: 12].
